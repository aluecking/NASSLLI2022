							<h1>Dialogue across the lifespan</h1>
							<p>NASSLLI 2022 workshop. Monday, June 20th -- Friday, June 24th, 2PM--3:20PM, Taper Hall 116.

							What are the desiderata for a theory of dialogue? The course will present two desiderata, one rather classical in its emphases, the other relating to more recent developments. The first desideratum can be related to the classical version of the Turing test—model/simulate the ability of an adult agent to participate in a conversation. Even a restricted version of the test—the ability to simulate the range of possible responses to a question is a significant challenge for all current theories of dialogue. In the first part of the course we will present a framework that has one of the most detailed attempts at meeting Turing’s challenge: the KoS framework, which is formally underpinned by a Type Theory with Records. KoS synthesizes: speech act theory, Wittgensteinian language games, formal semantics, and conversational analysis to yield a detailed theory of dialogical relevance from the micro-level (self-repairs, interjections) to the macro-level (the structure of complete conversations). This provides a theory of context that can underpin the analysis of a variety of dialogical phenomena such as non-sentential utterances, repair, and quotation. However, it also provides a new perspective on well trodden phenomena such as quantification and compositionality. We introduce a more challenging desideratum: dialogue across the lifespan—from interaction with infants at different developmental stages and concluding with the effects aging has on interaction. To address this desideratum, we will show how non-verbal social signals such as crying, laughter, and smiling, which are present both among non-human primates and infants and develop into highly complex behaviours among adults can be integrated into KoS. This requires us to integrate multimodality in the framework and to consider manual and head gestures. We will consider how to model the earliest grammars among children, where semantic complexity is achieved by exploiting both visual and interactive context. We will conclude by discussion of aging and how it requires us to confront forgetting, an aspect missing from contemporary work on dialogue.
